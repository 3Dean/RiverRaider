# Fuel Depletion System - Complete Implementation

## Overview
The fuel depletion system has been fully implemented to make the PlayerShip (riverraid_hero) lose thrust and fall to the terrain when fuel is depleted, exactly as requested.

## System Architecture

### Core Components
1. **PlayerShipFuel.cs** - Manages fuel consumption and levels
2. **FlightData.cs** - Stores flight state and fuel-related properties
3. **UnifiedFlightController.cs** - Handles all flight physics including fuel depletion effects
4. **FuelDepletionExtension.cs** - Extension methods for fuel calculations

### Key Features Implemented

#### 1. Fuel Consumption System
- **Continuous Fuel Burn**: Fuel depletes over time based on engine usage
- **Throttle-Based Consumption**: More fuel consumed when using throttle (W/S keys)
- **Speed-Based Consumption**: Higher speeds consume more fuel
- **Fuel Percentage Tracking**: Real-time fuel level monitoring

#### 2. Engine Power Degradation
- **Gradual Power Loss**: Engine power fades gradually when fuel runs out
- **Throttle Effectiveness Reduction**: W/S keys become less effective as fuel depletes
- **Engine Power Multiplier**: Scales from 1.0 (full power) to 0.0 (no power)
- **Configurable Fade Time**: How quickly engine power degrades after fuel depletion

#### 3. Gravity and Falling Effects
- **Gravity Application**: When engine stops, gravity pulls the aircraft down
- **World Space Translation**: Aircraft falls in world coordinates (downward)
- **Configurable Gravity Force**: Adjustable falling speed in FlightData

#### 4. Stall and Glide Physics
- **Stall Detection**: Aircraft stalls when speed drops below minimum threshold
- **Control Reduction**: Severely reduced mouse control during stall (30% effectiveness)
- **Glide Drag**: Higher drag coefficient when engine is off
- **Emergency Landing**: Detection of critically low speeds

#### 5. Realistic Flight Behavior
- **Lift System**: Aircraft maintains altitude when engine is running and speed is sufficient
- **No Lift When Engine Off**: Aircraft cannot maintain altitude without engine power
- **Speed-Dependent Lift**: More speed = more lift force
- **Minimum Speed for Lift**: Below certain speed, no lift is generated

## Implementation Details

### FlightData Properties
```csharp
[Header("Fuel Depletion Physics")]
public float gravityForce = 9.8f;           // Downward force when engine off
public float glideDragCoefficient = 0.02f;  // Extra drag when unpowered
public float stallSpeed = 15f;              // Speed below which aircraft stalls
public float enginePowerFadeTime = 3f;      // Time for engine power to fade to zero
public float enginePowerMultiplier = 1f;    // Current engine power (1.0 = full, 0.0 = none)
```

### Fuel Depletion Sequence
1. **Normal Flight**: Full engine power, normal throttle response
2. **Fuel Warning**: Fuel level drops below threshold
3. **Fuel Depletion**: Fuel reaches zero, engine power begins fading
4. **Power Loss**: Engine power multiplier decreases over time
5. **Gravity Effects**: Aircraft begins falling due to gravity
6. **Stall Risk**: If speed drops too low, aircraft enters stall
7. **Crash Landing**: Aircraft impacts terrain

### Debug Messages
The system provides comprehensive debug logging:
- `"FUEL DEPLETED! Engine power fading..."`
- `"REDUCED ENGINE POWER: 45% - Fuel: 0%"`
- `"AIRCRAFT STALLING! Speed: 12.3 MPH (below 15.0 MPH) - CONTROLS REDUCED!"`
- `"GLIDING - Speed: 25.1 MPH, Engine: OFF, Fuel: 0%"`
- `"EMERGENCY! Aircraft below minimum safe speed: 8.7 MPH"`

## Testing the System

### How to Test Fuel Depletion
1. **Start the Game**: Aircraft begins with full fuel
2. **Fly Normally**: Use W/S keys to control throttle
3. **Monitor Fuel**: Watch fuel gauge decrease over time
4. **Wait for Depletion**: Let fuel run completely out
5. **Observe Effects**: 
   - Throttle becomes less responsive
   - Aircraft begins falling
   - Speed decreases due to drag
   - Control becomes difficult at low speeds

### Expected Behavior
- **With Fuel**: Normal flight, responsive controls, maintains altitude
- **Fuel Depleting**: Gradual power loss, reduced throttle effectiveness
- **No Fuel**: Aircraft falls, glides with reduced control, eventual stall

### Fuel Refueling
- **Fuel Barges**: Colliding with fuel barges restores fuel
- **Automatic Refuel**: Fuel level increases when touching fuel barge
- **Engine Restart**: Engine power immediately restored when fuel is available

## Configuration Options

### Adjustable Parameters in FlightData
- **gravityForce**: How fast aircraft falls (default: 9.8)
- **glideDragCoefficient**: Drag when unpowered (default: 0.02)
- **stallSpeed**: Minimum speed before stall (default: 15 MPH)
- **enginePowerFadeTime**: Power fade duration (default: 3 seconds)
- **liftForce**: Upward force when engine running (default: 15)
- **minSpeedForLift**: Minimum speed needed for lift (default: 5 MPH)

### Fuel System Settings in PlayerShipFuel
- **maxFuel**: Maximum fuel capacity
- **fuelConsumptionRate**: Base fuel consumption per second
- **throttleFuelMultiplier**: Extra consumption when using throttle

## Integration with Existing Systems

### UI Integration
- **Fuel Gauge**: Shows current fuel percentage
- **Speed Indicator**: Shows airspeed changes during fuel depletion
- **Warning Systems**: Visual/audio warnings when fuel is low

### Weapon System Integration
- **Fuel Consumption**: Weapons may consume additional fuel
- **Power Requirements**: Some weapons may not work without engine power

### Terrain Collision
- **Crash Detection**: System detects when aircraft hits terrain
- **Damage System**: Integration with health system for crash damage
