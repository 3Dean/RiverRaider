# üö® CRITICAL MOUSE INPUT DIAGNOSTIC

## üîç **PROBLEM IDENTIFIED**

**CRITICAL ISSUE:** Mouse input is NOT being detected at all!

From your debug display:
- **Mouse: X=0.00, Y=0.00** ‚Üê This should change when you move mouse
- **Controls: Yaw=0.00, Pitch=0.00** ‚Üê No rotation values
- **Banking: 0.0¬∞** ‚Üê Banking works because it's calculated from mouse input

## üß™ **DIAGNOSTIC STEPS**

### **1. Test Mouse Input Detection**
**Move your mouse now and check the console for these messages:**

**Expected Messages:**
```
RAW Mouse: X=0.1234, Y=-0.0567 | SCALED: X=24.68, Y=-11.34
MOUSE DETECTED! Raw: X=0.1234, Y=-0.0567 | Scaled: X=24.68, Y=-11.34
```

**If you see NO messages:** Mouse input is completely blocked
**If you see messages:** Mouse input is working, but rotation logic is broken

### **2. Cursor Lock State Test**
I've changed the cursor lock to `CursorLockMode.None` to ensure input isn't blocked.

### **3. Possible Causes**

**A. Unity Input System Conflict:**
- New Input System vs Legacy Input System
- Input Manager settings wrong
- Mouse axes not configured

**B. Window Focus Issues:**
- Game window not focused
- Unity Editor stealing input
- Another application blocking input

**C. Hardware/Driver Issues:**
- Mouse driver problems
- Unity not detecting mouse
- Input device conflicts

## üîß **IMMEDIATE TESTS**

### **Test 1: Basic Mouse Detection**
1. **Move your mouse** while game is running
2. **Check console** for "RAW Mouse" or "MOUSE DETECTED" messages
3. **Report what you see** (or don't see)

### **Test 2: Window Focus**
1. **Click on the game window** to ensure it has focus
2. **Move mouse** again
3. **Check for input messages**

### **Test 3: Input Manager Check**
1. **Go to Edit ‚Üí Project Settings ‚Üí Input Manager**
2. **Expand "Axes"**
3. **Find "Mouse X" and "Mouse Y"**
4. **Verify they exist and are enabled**

## üö® **CRITICAL DEBUGGING**

**The debug logging I added will show:**

1. **Every 10 frames:** Current raw mouse values (even if 0.0000)
2. **Any mouse movement:** Immediate detection with exact values
3. **Rotation attempts:** When the system tries to rotate

**If you see ZERO console messages about mouse input, the problem is:**
- Input system not working
- Mouse not being detected by Unity
- Input Manager configuration issue

## üéØ **NEXT STEPS**

**Please test now and report:**

1. **Do you see ANY mouse debug messages in console?**
2. **Does the debug display show Mouse X/Y changing when you move mouse?**
3. **Is the game window focused when you test?**
4. **Are you testing in Play mode in Unity Editor or built game?**

**This will tell us if it's:**
- ‚ùå **Input detection problem** (no messages)
- ‚ùå **Rotation logic problem** (messages but no rotation)
- ‚ùå **System configuration issue** (Unity/hardware)

## üîß **TEMPORARY WORKAROUND**

If mouse input is completely blocked, we may need to:
1. **Check Unity Input Manager settings**
2. **Switch to New Input System**
3. **Use alternative input methods**
4. **Debug Unity's input detection**

**Test the mouse input detection first - this is the critical diagnostic step!**
