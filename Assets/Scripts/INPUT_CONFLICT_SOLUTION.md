# 🎯 INPUT CONFLICT SOLUTION - FINAL FIX

## 🚨 **ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED**

The W/S keys weren't working because you have **THREE systems fighting over the same FlightData.airspeed**:

1. **RailMovementController** - Overrides FlightData.airspeed every frame
2. **SimpleFlightController** - Tries to set FlightData.airspeed  
3. **FlightSpeedController** - Also tries to modify FlightData.airspeed

**The RailMovementController was winning** because it runs in Update() and overwrites the airspeed value!

## ✅ **WHAT I FIXED**

### **1. Added Missing HealthPack Tag**
- Fixed the Console error: "Tag: HealthPack is not defined"
- Added "HealthPack" to Unity's TagManager

### **2. Enhanced SimpleFlightController**
- Added `LateUpdate()` to run **after** RailMovementController
- Now SimpleFlightController overrides other systems
- Better debug messages to distinguish from other controllers

## 🛠️ **TESTING INSTRUCTIONS**

### **Option A: Test with Both Controllers (Current Setup)**
1. **Press Play** in Unity
2. **Press W/S keys** 
3. **Check Console** - you should now see:
   ```
   SimpleFlightController: Initialized on riverraid_hero with speed 20
   W Key - Speed UP: 25.3 MPH (+1.5)
   SimpleFlightController - Current Speed: 25.3 MPH
   ```

### **Option B: Clean Setup (Recommended)**
1. **Disable RailMovementController** component temporarily
2. **Keep only SimpleFlightController** active
3. **Test W/S keys** - should work perfectly
4. **Re-enable RailMovementController** later if needed

## 🎮 **EXPECTED RESULTS**

With the fix, you should see:
- ✅ **W Key increases speed** (visible in Console)
- ✅ **S Key decreases speed** (visible in Console)  
- ✅ **On-screen debug display** showing current speed
- ✅ **No HealthPack tag errors**
- ✅ **Altimeter should work** (FlightData is now properly accessible)

## 🔧 **IF STILL NOT WORKING**

### **Quick Diagnostic:**
1. **Check Console** for "SimpleFlightController: Initialized" message
2. **Look for W/S key debug messages** when pressing keys
3. **Verify on-screen debug display** appears (top-left corner)

### **Nuclear Option:**
If still broken, **disable ALL other flight controllers**:
1. Disable **RailMovementController**
2. Disable **FlightSpeedController** 
3. Disable **FlightInputController**
4. Keep only **SimpleFlightController** + **FlightData**

## 💡 **SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE**

```
BEFORE (Broken):
RailMovementController ──┐
SimpleFlightController ──┼──► FlightData.airspeed ◄── CONFLICT!
FlightSpeedController ───┘

AFTER (Fixed):
RailMovementController (Update) ──► FlightData.airspeed
SimpleFlightController (LateUpdate) ──► FlightData.airspeed ✅ WINS!
```

## 🚁 **ALTIMETER FIX**

The altimeter should now work because:
- ✅ **HealthPack tag error fixed** (was blocking other systems)
- ✅ **FlightData.airspeed properly managed** by SimpleFlightController
- ✅ **Aircraft reference should auto-find** the riverraid_hero with FlightData

If altimeter still shows wrong height:
1. **Find AltimeterUI component** (on UI Canvas)
2. **Drag riverraid_hero** into "Aircraft Reference" field
3. **Check "Use Ground Relative Altitude"** is enabled

---

**The W/S keys should now work! The real problem was multiple systems overwriting each other's speed values. SimpleFlightController now runs in LateUpdate() to have the final say! 🚁✨**
