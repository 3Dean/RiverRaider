# 🔄 UNITY SCRIPT REFRESH FIX

## 🎯 **PROBLEM IDENTIFIED**

You're seeing an old ChunkSpawner interface with "Pickups" section, but the actual script file is the correct modular version. This is a Unity caching/compilation issue.

## 🛠️ **SOLUTION STEPS**

### **Step 1: Force Unity to Refresh Scripts**

1. **In Unity Editor**: Go to **Assets → Refresh** (or press Ctrl+R)
2. **Or**: Go to **Assets → Reimport All**
3. **Wait** for Unity to finish compiling

### **Step 2: Clear Unity Cache (if Step 1 doesn't work)**

1. **Close Unity completely**
2. **Delete these folders** in your project directory:
   - `Library/`
   - `Temp/`
3. **Reopen Unity** - it will regenerate these folders

### **Step 3: Verify the Correct Script**

1. **In Unity Inspector**, click on the script reference next to "ChunkSpawner"
2. **It should highlight** `Assets/Scripts/Spawning/ChunkSpawner.cs`
3. **If it highlights a different file**, that's the problem!

### **Step 4: Replace Component (if needed)**

If you're still seeing the wrong interface:

1. **Remove the current component**:
   - Click the gear icon next to "Chunk Spawner (Script)"
   - Select "Remove Component"

2. **Add the correct component**:
   - Click "Add Component"
   - Search for "ChunkSpawner"
   - **Choose the one from the Spawning folder**

3. **Configure the new component**:
   ```
   Terrain Configuration:
   ├── Player: [Drag riverraid_hero here]
   ├── Chunk Prefabs: [Assign your 3 terrain prefabs]
   ├── Chunk Length: 300
   └── Chunks Visible: 5
   
   Debug:
   └── Show Debug Logs: ☐
   ```

## ✅ **EXPECTED RESULT**

After the fix, you should see:
- **Terrain Configuration** section (NOT "Pickups")
- **Debug** section
- **NO** Fuel Spawner or Health Spawner fields

## 🚨 **IF PROBLEM PERSISTS**

If you're still seeing the old interface, there might be a hidden original ChunkSpawner script. Let me know and I'll help you find and remove it.

**The modular architecture is correct - this is just a Unity caching issue! 🔧**
