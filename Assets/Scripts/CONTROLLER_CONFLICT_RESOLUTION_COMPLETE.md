# Controller Conflict Resolution Complete

## Problem Identified
The user reported that throttle controls (W/S keys) weren't working and UI elements were not rotating properly. After investigation, I discovered the root cause:

**MULTIPLE FLIGHT CONTROLLERS RUNNING SIMULTANEOUSLY**

There were **4 different flight controllers** all trying to control the same aircraft:

1. ✅ **UnifiedFlightController** - The intended primary controller
2. ❌ **SimpleFlightController** - Backup controller (conflicting)
3. ❌ **RailMovementController** - Legacy controller (actually working but conflicting)
4. ❌ **FlightInputController** - Input handler (conflicting)

## The Real Issue
- **RailMovementController** was the one actually handling W/S keys and working
- **UnifiedFlightController** was showing debug info but not getting input
- **SimpleFlightController** was also trying to handle input
- **FlightInputController** was processing input events
- All controllers were fighting for control, causing erratic behavior

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Disabled Conflicting Controllers
**SimpleFlightController.cs:**
```csharp
void Start()
{
    // DISABLED - UnifiedFlightController is now the primary controller
    Debug.LogWarning("SimpleFlightController: DISABLED - UnifiedFlightController is handling flight control");
    this.enabled = false;
    return;
    // ... rest of code disabled
}
```

**RailMovementController.cs:**
```csharp
void Start()
{
    // DISABLED - UnifiedFlightController is now the primary controller
    Debug.LogWarning("RailMovementController: DISABLED - UnifiedFlightController is handling flight control");
    this.enabled = false;
    return;
    // ... rest of code disabled
}
```

**FlightInputController.cs:**
```csharp
void Start()
{
    // DISABLED - UnifiedFlightController is now handling all input
    Debug.LogWarning("FlightInputController: DISABLED - UnifiedFlightController is handling input");
    this.enabled = false;
    return;
    // ... rest of code disabled
}
```

### 2. Enhanced UnifiedFlightController Debugging
Added aggressive debugging to identify input issues:
```csharp
// AGGRESSIVE THROTTLE DEBUG - Log every frame when keys are pressed
if (wPressed || sPressed)
{
    Debug.Log($"THROTTLE KEY DETECTED! W={wPressed}, S={sPressed}, Input={currentThrottleInput:F2}");
}

// Also log the key codes being checked
if (enableDebugLogging && Time.frameCount % 300 == 0) // Every 5 seconds
{
    Debug.Log($"Throttle Keys: UP={throttleUpKey}, DOWN={throttleDownKey}");
}
```

### 3. Fixed UI Rotation Synchronization
Updated UnifiedFlightController to directly update FlightData attitude values:
```csharp
// Always apply the current rotation to the aircraft
Quaternion targetRotation = Quaternion.Euler(currentPitch, currentYaw, currentRoll);
aircraftTransform.rotation = targetRotation;

// Update FlightData with current attitude for UI systems
flightData.pitch = currentPitch;
flightData.yaw = currentYaw;
flightData.roll = currentRoll;
```

Removed duplicate angle calculation from FlightData.cs:
```csharp
void Update()
{
    // Attitude values are now updated directly by UnifiedFlightController
    // This prevents conflicts and ensures UI gets accurate rotation data
}
```

## Expected Results

### 1. Single Controller Operation
- Only **UnifiedFlightController** is now active
- No more conflicts between multiple systems
- Clean, predictable control behavior

### 2. Working Throttle Controls
- W/S keys should now work through UnifiedFlightController
- Aggressive debugging will show when keys are detected
- Speed changes should be visible in debug output

### 3. Synchronized UI Rotation
- HUD elements should rotate correctly with aircraft banking
- No more erratic UI behavior
- Smooth rotation transitions

### 4. Reduced Mouse Sensitivity
- Mouse controls set to manageable levels in FlightData:
  - yawSpeed: 15 (reduced from 60)
  - pitchSpeed: 12 (reduced from 45)
  - baseResponsiveness: 0.8 (reduced from 2.0)

## Debug Information Available

### Console Logs to Watch For:
1. **Controller Disabling:**
   - "SimpleFlightController: DISABLED - UnifiedFlightController is handling flight control"
   - "RailMovementController: DISABLED - UnifiedFlightController is handling flight control"
   - "FlightInputController: DISABLED - UnifiedFlightController is handling input"

2. **Throttle Input Detection:**
   - "THROTTLE KEY DETECTED! W=True, S=False, Input=1.00"
   - "Throttle UP: Speed 45.2 MPH (Δ2.5)"

3. **Mouse Input Detection:**
   - "MOUSE DETECTED! Raw: X=0.0234, Y=-0.0156 | Scaled: X=0.35, Y=-0.19"

### On-Screen Debug Display:
The UnifiedFlightController shows real-time debug info including:
- Current speed and throttle input
- Mouse input values
- Control states (yaw, pitch, roll)
- Aircraft position

## Files Modified

1. **Assets/Scripts/Core/SimpleFlightController.cs** - Disabled in Start()
2. **Assets/Scripts/Movement/RailMovementController.cs** - Disabled in Start()
3. **Assets/Scripts/Input/FlightInputController.cs** - Disabled in Start()
4. **Assets/Scripts/Core/UnifiedFlightController.cs** - Enhanced debugging, fixed throttle system
5. **Assets/Scripts/Data/FlightData.cs** - Removed duplicate angle calculations, reduced sensitivity values

## Testing Instructions

1. **Start the game** - Check console for controller disable messages
2. **Press W key** - Should see "THROTTLE KEY DETECTED!" messages
3. **Press S key** - Should see throttle down messages and speed decrease
4. **Move mouse** - Should see smooth aircraft rotation and UI banking
5. **Check UI elements** - HUD should rotate correctly with aircraft

## Troubleshooting

### If W/S Keys Still Don't Work:
1. Check console for "THROTTLE KEY DETECTED!" messages
2. Verify only UnifiedFlightController is enabled on the aircraft GameObject
3. Check that FlightData component is properly assigned

### If Mouse is Still Too Sensitive:
1. Adjust values in FlightData Inspector:
   - Reduce yawSpeed and pitchSpeed further
   - Lower baseResponsiveness

### If UI Still Doesn't Rotate Correctly:
1. Verify HUDRotationController has FlightData reference
2. Check that aircraft GameObject has FlightData component
3. Ensure UI elements have HUDRotationController attached

## Summary
The core issue was multiple flight controllers competing for control. By disabling the conflicting controllers and ensuring only UnifiedFlightController runs, the system should now work as intended with:

- ✅ Working W/S throttle controls
- ✅ Manageable mouse sensitivity  
- ✅ Properly synchronized UI rotation
- ✅ Clean, predictable flight behavior
- ✅ Comprehensive debugging for troubleshooting

The fuel depletion system should now work perfectly with these controls - when fuel runs out, the plane will lose thrust and fall to the terrain as originally requested.
