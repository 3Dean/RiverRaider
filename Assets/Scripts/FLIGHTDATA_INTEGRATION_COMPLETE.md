# FlightData Integration Complete

## Overview
Successfully integrated the UnifiedFlightController with the FlightData component to create a unified, inspector-configurable flight system. All hardcoded values have been replaced with FlightData references, giving you full control over flight behavior through the Unity Inspector.

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Hardcoded Variables
**Removed from UnifiedFlightController:**
- `mouseYawSensitivity` → Now uses `flightData.GetSpeedAdjustedYawSpeed()`
- `mousePitchSensitivity` → Now uses `flightData.GetSpeedAdjustedPitchSpeed()`
- `bankingStrength` → Now uses `flightData.maxBankAngle`
- `bankingSmoothTime` → Now uses `1f / flightData.bankLerpSpeed`
- `dragCoefficient` → Now uses `flightData.dragCoefficient`
- `slopeEffect` → Now uses `flightData.slopeEffect`

### 2. FlightData Integration Points
**Mouse Sensitivity:**
```csharp
// OLD: Fixed values
currentMouseX = rawMouseX * mouseYawSensitivity;
currentMouseY = rawMouseY * mousePitchSensitivity;

// NEW: Speed-responsive values from FlightData
currentMouseX = rawMouseX * flightData.GetSpeedAdjustedYawSpeed();
currentMouseY = rawMouseY * flightData.GetSpeedAdjustedPitchSpeed();
```

**Banking System:**
```csharp
// OLD: Fixed banking strength
targetRoll = -currentMouseX * bankingStrength * 0.1f;

// NEW: Uses FlightData max bank angle
targetRoll = -currentMouseX * flightData.maxBankAngle * 0.1f;
```

**Physics Systems:**
```csharp
// Drag now uses FlightData coefficient
float dragForce = flightData.dragCoefficient * flightData.airspeed * flightData.airspeed * deltaTime;

// Slope effects use FlightData settings
float slopeSpeedChange = flightData.slopeEffect * slope * deltaTime;
```

## Inspector Control

### FlightData Component Settings
You can now control all flight behavior through the FlightData component in the Inspector:

**Mouse Look & Bank:**
- `yawSpeed`: Controls yaw sensitivity (default: 60)
- `pitchSpeed`: Controls pitch sensitivity (default: 45)
- `maxBankAngle`: Maximum roll angle during turns (default: 30°)
- `bankLerpSpeed`: How quickly banking responds (default: 2)

**Speed-Dependent Responsiveness:**
- `baseResponsiveness`: Control sensitivity at low speed (default: 2)
- `highSpeedResponsiveness`: Control sensitivity at high speed (default: 0.8)
- `speedResponsivenessEffect`: How much speed affects controls (default: 0.5)

**Physics Settings:**
- `dragCoefficient`: Air resistance (default: 0.02)
- `slopeEffect`: How much climbing/diving affects speed (default: 100)
- `maxSlopeAngle`: Maximum slope angle for effects (default: 45°)

**Fuel Depletion Physics:**
- `gravityForce`: Downward force when out of fuel (default: 9.81)
- `enginePowerFadeTime`: Time for engine to fade (default: 3s)
- `stallSpeed`: Speed below which plane stalls (default: 15)
- `glideDragCoefficient`: Drag when gliding (default: 0.05)

## Benefits

### 1. Single Source of Truth
- All flight parameters are now in FlightData
- No duplicate settings across multiple scripts
- Easy to tune and balance gameplay

### 2. Speed-Responsive Controls
- Controls automatically adjust based on airspeed
- Better handling at both low and high speeds
- Realistic flight feel

### 3. Fuel Depletion Integration
- Engine power affects all flight systems
- Realistic stall and glide behavior
- Gravity effects when fuel depleted

### 4. Inspector Friendly
- All settings visible and adjustable in Inspector
- Real-time tuning during play mode
- Clear parameter organization with headers

## Testing Recommendations

### 1. Basic Flight Test
1. Start the game with full fuel
2. Test mouse controls for pitch/yaw sensitivity
3. Verify banking behavior during turns
4. Check speed responsiveness at different airspeeds

### 2. Fuel Depletion Test
1. Reduce fuel to zero in Inspector during play
2. Verify engine power fades over time
3. Check that plane loses thrust and falls
4. Test stall behavior at low speeds

### 3. Physics Tuning
1. Adjust `dragCoefficient` to change air resistance
2. Modify `slopeEffect` to test climbing/diving impact
3. Tune `gravityForce` for realistic fall rate
4. Test `stallSpeed` threshold

## Next Steps

### 1. Fine-Tuning
- Test flight feel and adjust FlightData parameters
- Balance fuel consumption rates
- Tune stall and recovery behavior

### 2. Additional Features
- Add engine restart when fuel is restored
- Implement emergency landing mechanics
- Add altitude-based effects

### 3. UI Integration
- Connect fuel gauge to FlightData.currentFuel
- Show engine status indicators
- Display stall warnings
