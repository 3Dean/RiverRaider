# Speed-Dependent Fuel System Enhancement

## ✅ COMPLETED ENHANCEMENTS:

### 1. FlightData Fuel Integration
**Location**: `Assets/Scripts/Data/FlightData.cs`
**Added**:
- ✅ **Speed-dependent fuel consumption**: More speed = more fuel usage
- ✅ **Boost multiplier**: Extra fuel consumption when boosting
- ✅ **Configurable fuel parameters**: Base consumption, speed multiplier, boost multiplier
- ✅ **Fuel management methods**: ConsumeFuel(), RefuelToFull(), AddFuel(), etc.

### 2. Enhanced PlayerShipFuel
**Location**: `Assets/Scripts/PlayerShipFuel.cs`
**Changes**:
- ✅ **Integrated with FlightData**: Uses centralized fuel system
- ✅ **Speed-responsive consumption**: Fuel bar reflects real-time consumption
- ✅ **Enhanced refueling**: Configurable refuel rate
- ✅ **Built-in debugging tools**: Test methods and consumption rate display

## 🔥 **FUEL CONSUMPTION FORMULA:**

### **Simplified Speed-Based Formula:**
```
Fuel Consumption Rate = Base Consumption + (Speed × Speed Multiplier)
```

### **Example Calculations:**
- **At 20 MPH (idle)**: 1.0 + (20 × 0.02) = **1.4 fuel/sec**
- **At 100 MPH (cruising)**: 1.0 + (100 × 0.02) = **3.0 fuel/sec**
- **At 200 MPH (max speed)**: 1.0 + (200 × 0.02) = **5.0 fuel/sec**

**Note**: W key acceleration increases speed, which directly increases fuel consumption - no separate boost system needed!

## 🎛️ **CONFIGURATION SETTINGS:**

### **FlightData Fuel Settings:**
```csharp
[Header("Fuel System")]
maxFuel = 100f;                    // Maximum fuel capacity
baseFuelConsumption = 1f;          // Fuel/sec at minimum speed
speedFuelMultiplier = 0.02f;       // Extra fuel per MPH
boostFuelMultiplier = 3f;          // Boost consumption multiplier
```

### **Recommended Settings:**
- **Conservative**: Base=0.5, Speed=0.01, Boost=2.0
- **Balanced**: Base=1.0, Speed=0.02, Boost=3.0 ✅ (Current)
- **Aggressive**: Base=1.5, Speed=0.03, Boost=4.0

## 🔧 **SETUP INSTRUCTIONS:**

### **Step 1: Configure FlightData**
1. **Select riverraid_hero** in hierarchy
2. **In FlightData component**, set fuel parameters:
   - Max Fuel: 100
   - Base Fuel Consumption: 1.0
   - Speed Fuel Multiplier: 0.02
   - Boost Fuel Multiplier: 3.0

### **Step 2: Update PlayerShipFuel**
1. **Select fuel system GameObject** (wherever PlayerShipFuel is attached)
2. **Configure PlayerShipFuel**:
   - Flight Data: Drag riverraid_hero here
   - Fuel Slider: Drag your fuel bar slider here
   - Refuel Rate: 50 (fuel per second when at fuel barge)

### **Step 3: Test the System**
**Built-in Test Methods** (Right-click PlayerShipFuel in Inspector):
- **Test Consume Fuel (20)**: Removes 20 fuel instantly
- **Test Refuel to Full**: Instantly refills fuel tank
- **Show Fuel Consumption Rate**: Displays current consumption in console

## 📊 **VISUAL FEEDBACK:**

### **Fuel Bar Behavior:**
- ✅ **Slow drain at low speeds** (20-30 MPH)
- ✅ **Moderate drain at cruise speeds** (50-80 MPH)
- ✅ **Fast drain at high speeds** (100+ MPH)
- ✅ **Rapid drain when boosting** (W key held)

### **Console Feedback:**
- **Fuel consumption rate** logged every 3 seconds
- **Refueling messages** when at fuel barges
- **Out of fuel warnings** when fuel depleted

## 🚀 **GAMEPLAY IMPACT:**

### **Strategic Fuel Management:**
- ✅ **Speed vs Efficiency**: Players must balance speed with fuel consumption
- ✅ **Boost Usage**: Boosting becomes a strategic decision
- ✅ **Route Planning**: Players need to plan routes around fuel barges
- ✅ **Risk/Reward**: High speed = higher fuel cost but faster progress

### **Realistic Flight Mechanics:**
- ✅ **Authentic feel**: Faster flight consumes more fuel (like real aircraft)
- ✅ **Boost consequences**: Afterburner/boost has significant fuel cost
- ✅ **Resource management**: Adds strategic depth to gameplay

## 🔍 **DEBUGGING TOOLS:**

### **Real-time Monitoring:**
```csharp
// Get current fuel consumption rate
float rate = flightData.GetCurrentFuelConsumptionRate();
Debug.Log($"Consuming {rate:F2} fuel/sec");

// Check fuel status
bool hasFuel = flightData.HasFuel();
float fuelPercent = flightData.GetFuelPercentage();
```

### **Test Scenarios:**
1. **Idle Test**: Let plane sit idle, fuel should drain slowly
2. **Speed Test**: Accelerate with W key, watch fuel drain increase
3. **Boost Test**: Hold boost, fuel should drain rapidly
4. **Refuel Test**: Visit fuel barge, fuel should refill

## 🔧 **TROUBLESHOOTING:**

### **Fuel Not Draining:**
1. Check that PlayerShipFuel has FlightData reference
2. Verify FlightData.ConsumeFuel() is being called
3. Check fuel consumption settings aren't set to 0

### **Fuel Bar Not Updating:**
1. Verify fuel slider is assigned in PlayerShipFuel
2. Check that UpdateFuelUI() is being called
3. Ensure slider value range is 0-1

### **Speed Not Affecting Fuel:**
1. Check speedFuelMultiplier > 0 in FlightData
2. Verify airspeed is being updated correctly
3. Use "Show Fuel Consumption Rate" test method

## ✨ **FINAL RESULT:**
- **Realistic fuel consumption** based on flight speed
- **Strategic gameplay** requiring fuel management
- **Visual feedback** through responsive fuel bar
- **Professional debugging tools** for fine-tuning
- **Configurable parameters** for different difficulty levels

## 🎯 **FUEL CONSUMPTION EXAMPLES:**

| Speed (MPH) | Base Rate | Speed Component | Total Rate | Fuel Duration |
|-------------|-----------|-----------------|------------|---------------|
| 20          | 1.0       | 0.4             | 1.4/sec    | ~71 seconds   |
| 50          | 1.0       | 1.0             | 2.0/sec    | ~50 seconds   |
| 100         | 1.0       | 2.0             | 3.0/sec    | ~33 seconds   |
| 150         | 1.0       | 3.0             | 4.0/sec    | ~25 seconds   |
| 200         | 1.0       | 4.0             | 5.0/sec    | ~20 seconds   |

**W key acceleration increases speed, which directly increases fuel consumption!**
