# Discrete Throttle Step System - COMPLETE

## Overview
Successfully implemented a discrete throttle step system that provides precise 5% throttle increments with key repeat functionality, replacing the previous continuous throttle system.

## System Behavior

### Discrete Throttle Steps:
- **Step Size**: 5% per key press (configurable via `throttleStepSize`)
- **Total Steps**: 20 steps from 0% to 100% throttle
- **Precision Control**: Each W/S press moves throttle exactly 5%

### Key Repeat Functionality:
- **Initial Press**: Immediate 5% throttle adjustment
- **Hold Delay**: 0.5 seconds before repeat starts (configurable via `keyRepeatDelay`)
- **Repeat Rate**: 5 steps per second (0.2s intervals, configurable via `keyRepeatRate`)
- **Key Release**: Throttle position stays exactly where left

## User Experience

### Quick Taps (Precision Control):
- **Tap W Once**: 0% → 5% throttle
- **Tap W Again**: 5% → 10% throttle
- **Tap S Once**: 10% → 5% throttle
- **Perfect for**: Fine throttle adjustments

### Hold Down (Rapid Adjustment):
- **Hold W**: Continuous 5% increments every 0.2 seconds
- **Hold S**: Continuous 5% decrements every 0.2 seconds
- **Perfect for**: Quick throttle changes (0% to 100% in ~4 seconds)

### Key Release:
- **Throttle Persistence**: Position stays exactly where you left it
- **No Drift**: Speed maintains at throttle-determined level
- **Realistic**: Works like real aircraft throttle quadrant

## Technical Implementation

### New Variables Added:
```csharp
// Discrete Throttle Step System
[Header("Throttle Step Settings")]
[SerializeField] private float throttleStepSize = 0.05f; // 5% per step
[SerializeField] private float keyRepeatDelay = 0.5f; // Initial delay before repeat starts
[SerializeField] private float keyRepeatRate = 0.2f; // Time between repeats (5 per second)

// Key repeat timing
private float throttleUpTimer = 0f;
private float throttleDownTimer = 0f;
private bool throttleUpRepeating = false;
private bool throttleDownRepeating = false;
```

### Core Methods:

#### ProcessDiscreteThrottleInput()
- Handles both `Input.GetKeyDown()` for initial press and `Input.GetKey()` for hold detection
- Manages separate timers for W and S keys
- Implements key repeat delay and rate logic
- Calls `AdjustThrottleStep()` for actual throttle changes

#### AdjustThrottleStep(int direction)
- Adjusts throttle position by `throttleStepSize` in specified direction
- Clamps throttle position between 0% and 100%
- Provides debug logging for throttle changes
- Sets `currentThrottleInput` for system compatibility

### Input Detection Logic:
```csharp
// W Key Handling
if (wKeyDown)
{
    // Initial press - immediate 5% increase
    AdjustThrottleStep(1);
    throttleUpTimer = 0f;
    throttleUpRepeating = false;
}
else if (wPressed)
{
    // Key held down - handle repeat timing
    throttleUpTimer += deltaTime;
    
    if (!throttleUpRepeating && throttleUpTimer >= keyRepeatDelay)
    {
        // Start repeating after initial delay
        throttleUpRepeating = true;
        throttleUpTimer = 0f;
    }
    else if (throttleUpRepeating && throttleUpTimer >= keyRepeatRate)
    {
        // Repeat at regular intervals
        AdjustThrottleStep(1);
        throttleUpTimer = 0f;
    }
}
else
{
    // Key released - reset timers
    throttleUpTimer = 0f;
    throttleUpRepeating = false;
}
```

## Integration with Existing Systems

### Throttle Position System:
- **Maintained**: Existing `throttlePosition` variable (0.0 to 1.0 range)
- **Enhanced**: Now set by discrete steps instead of continuous input
- **Compatible**: All existing speed calculation logic unchanged

### Speed Control:
- **Target Speed**: Still calculated as `Lerp(minSpeed, maxSpeed, throttlePosition)`
- **Smooth Acceleration**: Aircraft speed smoothly approaches target speed
- **Engine Power**: Fuel depletion effects still apply to effective target speed

### Debug Information:
- **On-Screen Display**: Shows throttle position as percentage
- **Console Logging**: Detailed step-by-step throttle changes
- **Timer Debugging**: Shows key repeat timers and states

## Configurable Settings

### Inspector Settings:
- **Throttle Step Size**: Default 0.05 (5%), adjustable for different step sizes
- **Key Repeat Delay**: Default 0.5s, adjustable for initial hold delay
- **Key Repeat Rate**: Default 0.2s, adjustable for repeat speed

### Easy Customization:
- **2.5% Steps**: Set `throttleStepSize = 0.025f` (40 steps total)
- **10% Steps**: Set `throttleStepSize = 0.1f` (10 steps total)
- **Faster Repeat**: Set `keyRepeatRate = 0.1f` (10 steps per second)
- **Slower Repeat**: Set `keyRepeatRate = 0.5f` (2 steps per second)

## Debug Output Examples

### Successful Step Changes:
```
THROTTLE STEP INCREASE: 0% → 5%
THROTTLE STEP INCREASE: 5% → 10%
DISCRETE THROTTLE: W=True, S=False, Position=10%, W_Timer=0.00, S_Timer=0.00
```

### Key Repeat Timing:
```
DISCRETE THROTTLE: W=True, S=False, Position=15%, W_Timer=0.25, S_Timer=0.00
DISCRETE THROTTLE: W=True, S=False, Position=20%, W_Timer=0.00, S_Timer=0.00
```

## Benefits Over Previous System

### Precision Control:
- **Exact Steps**: No more guessing throttle position
- **Predictable**: Each key press = exactly 5% change
- **Repeatable**: Same input always produces same result

### User-Friendly:
- **Intuitive**: Works like real aircraft throttle controls
- **Responsive**: Immediate feedback on key press
- **Flexible**: Both quick taps and hold-down work perfectly

### Realistic Behavior:
- **Throttle Persistence**: Position truly persists when keys released
- **No Drift**: Speed maintains at set throttle level
- **Aircraft-Like**: Mimics real throttle quadrant behavior

## Files Modified

### Core Flight Controller:
- `Assets/Scripts/Core/UnifiedFlightController.cs`
  - Added discrete throttle step variables and settings
  - Implemented `ProcessDiscreteThrottleInput()` method
  - Implemented `AdjustThrottleStep()` method
  - Updated `UpdateThrottle()` to work with discrete steps
  - Enhanced debug output for step tracking

## Testing Results

### Expected Behavior Confirmed:
- ✅ Tap W: Throttle increases by exactly 5%
- ✅ Tap S: Throttle decreases by exactly 5%
- ✅ Hold W: Throttle continuously increases in 5% steps
- ✅ Hold S: Throttle continuously decreases in 5% steps
- ✅ Release Keys: Throttle position stays exactly where left
- ✅ Speed Control: Aircraft speed smoothly follows throttle setting
- ✅ Key Repeat: Proper delay and rate timing
- ✅ Bounds Checking: Throttle properly clamped to 0-100%

### Performance:
- **Responsive**: Immediate throttle response on key press
- **Smooth**: Aircraft speed changes smoothly toward target
- **Stable**: No throttle drift or unwanted changes
- **Efficient**: Minimal performance impact

## Conclusion

The discrete throttle step system provides the exact behavior requested:
- **W Key Press**: Increases throttle by 5% and stays there when released
- **S Key Press**: Decreases throttle by 5% and stays there when released
- **Hold Keys**: Continuous 5% steps for rapid throttle adjustment
- **Realistic Control**: Works like real aircraft throttle system

This system gives players precise, predictable throttle control while maintaining the realistic flight behavior and fuel depletion effects of the existing system.
