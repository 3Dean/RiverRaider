# üöÅ FUEL DEPLETION SYSTEM - IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE ‚úÖ

## üìã **IMPLEMENTATION SUMMARY**

The complete fuel depletion system has been successfully implemented for the RiverRaider Unity project. When the PlayerShip (riverraid_hero) runs out of fuel, the plane will lose thrust and fall to the terrain, creating an authentic River Raid gameplay experience.

## ‚öôÔ∏è **SYSTEM CONFIGURATION**

### **Fuel Settings**
```csharp
// PlayerShipFuel.cs
public float maxFuel = 100f;
public float fuelConsumptionRate = 5f;  // Per second
public float refuelAmount = 30f;        // Per fuel barge
```

## üéÆ **GAMEPLAY MECHANICS**

### **Normal Flight**
1. **Fuel Consumption**: Continuous fuel drain during flight
2. **Fuel Monitoring**: Real-time fuel level display in UI
3. **Fuel Collection**: Automatic refueling when hitting fuel barges

### **Fuel Depletion Sequence**
1. **Fuel Reaches Zero**: PlayerShipFuel detects empty fuel tank
2. **Thrust Loss**: RailMovementController reduces thrust to zero
3. **Gravity Takes Over**: Aircraft begins falling due to gravity
4. **Terrain Impact**: Collision with terrain triggers crash sequence

### **Recovery Options**
- **Fuel Barges**: Collect fuel to restore thrust and continue flight
- **Emergency Landing**: Controlled descent to minimize crash damage
