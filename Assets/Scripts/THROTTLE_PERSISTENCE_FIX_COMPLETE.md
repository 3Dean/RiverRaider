# Throttle Persistence Fix - COMPLETE

## Problem Identified
The user reported that when pressing W to increase throttle and then releasing the W key, the speed was dropping back to around 30mph instead of maintaining the throttle position. This was happening despite the throttle position system being implemented.

## Root Causes Found

### 1. Initial Throttle Position
- **Problem**: Throttle started at 50% (`throttlePosition = 0.5f`)
- **Effect**: When W key was released, it tried to maintain 50% throttle, which corresponded to about 30mph
- **Fix**: Changed initial throttle to 0% (`throttlePosition = 0.0f`)

### 2. Drag System Interference
- **Problem**: Drag was applied when `currentThrottleInput` was 0 (key not pressed)
- **Effect**: Even with throttle position maintained, drag would pull speed down when keys weren't actively pressed
- **Fix**: Changed drag logic to only apply when `throttlePosition < 0.05f` (throttle at idle)

## Fixes Implemented

### Fix 1: Corrected Initial Throttle Position
```csharp
// OLD - Started at 50% throttle
private float throttlePosition = 0.5f; // Start at 50% throttle

// NEW - Start at idle (0% throttle)
private float throttlePosition = 0.0f; // Start at 0% throttle (idle)
```

### Fix 2: Fixed Drag Logic
```csharp
// OLD - Applied drag when keys weren't pressed
if (Mathf.Abs(currentThrottleInput) < 0.01f)
{
    // Apply drag - this interfered with throttle position maintenance
}

// NEW - Only apply drag when throttle is at idle position
if (throttlePosition < 0.05f) // Only apply drag when throttle is essentially at idle
{
    float dragForce = flightData.dragCoefficient * flightData.airspeed * flightData.airspeed * deltaTime;
    flightData.airspeed -= dragForce;
}
```

## Expected Behavior After Fix

### Realistic Aircraft Throttle System:
1. **Game Start**: Aircraft begins at 0% throttle (minimum speed)
2. **Press W**: Throttle position increases, speed increases toward new target
3. **Release W**: Throttle position stays exactly where you left it
4. **Speed Maintenance**: Speed maintains at the throttle-determined level
5. **Press S**: Throttle position decreases, speed decreases toward new target
6. **Drag Application**: Only applies when throttle is at 0% (idle position)

### Key Improvements:
- **True Throttle Persistence**: Throttle position now truly persists when keys are released
- **No Speed Regression**: Speed no longer drops back to 30mph when W is released
- **Realistic Behavior**: Works like a real aircraft throttle system
- **Proper Idle State**: Drag only applies when throttle is actually at idle

## Technical Details

### Throttle Position System:
- **Range**: 0.0 to 1.0 (0% to 100%)
- **Starting Position**: 0.0 (idle)
- **Change Rate**: 100% per second when keys held
- **Persistence**: Position maintained when keys released

### Target Speed Calculation:
```csharp
// Calculate target speed based on throttle position
targetSpeed = Mathf.Lerp(flightData.minSpeed, flightData.maxSpeed, throttlePosition);

// Apply engine power multiplier for fuel depletion effects
float effectiveTargetSpeed = targetSpeed * flightData.enginePowerMultiplier;
```

### Drag Logic:
```csharp
// Only apply drag when throttle is essentially at idle
if (throttlePosition < 0.05f) // 5% threshold for idle detection
{
    float dragForce = flightData.dragCoefficient * flightData.airspeed * flightData.airspeed * deltaTime;
    flightData.airspeed -= dragForce;
}
```

## Files Modified

### Core Flight Controller:
- `Assets/Scripts/Core/UnifiedFlightController.cs`
  - Changed initial throttle position from 0.5f to 0.0f
  - Fixed drag logic to check throttle position instead of input state
  - Updated debug logging for better throttle position tracking

## Testing Verification

### Test Scenarios:
1. **Start Game**: Verify aircraft starts at minimum speed (0% throttle)
2. **Press W**: Verify throttle increases and speed increases
3. **Release W**: Verify throttle position stays where left, speed maintains
4. **Press S**: Verify throttle decreases and speed decreases
5. **Idle Throttle**: Verify drag only applies when throttle at 0%

### Expected Results:
- ✅ No more speed regression to 30mph when W released
- ✅ Throttle position truly persists
- ✅ Speed maintains at throttle-determined level
- ✅ Realistic aircraft throttle behavior
- ✅ Proper idle state with drag application

## Debug Information

### On-Screen Debug Shows:
- **Throttle Position**: Current throttle setting (0-100%)
- **Target Speed**: Speed the throttle position is trying to achieve
- **Current Speed**: Actual aircraft speed
- **Engine Power**: Current engine power percentage

### Console Logging:
- Throttle position changes when W/S pressed
- Speed adjustments toward target speed
- Drag application only when throttle at idle
- Fuel depletion effects on engine power

## Conclusion

The throttle system now works exactly as requested:
- **W Key**: Increases throttle position (like pushing throttle forward)
- **S Key**: Decreases throttle position (like pulling throttle back)
- **Key Release**: Throttle position persists at current setting
- **Speed Behavior**: Speed maintains at throttle-determined level
- **Drag**: Only applies when throttle is at idle (0%)

This provides the realistic aircraft throttle behavior where the throttle setting determines and maintains the target speed, just like in real aircraft.
