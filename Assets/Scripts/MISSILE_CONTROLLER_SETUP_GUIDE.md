# MissileController Setup Guide

## Overview
The MissileController has been refactored to use your clean MissileTypeData ScriptableObjects instead of the old inline MissileData system.

## Setup Steps

### 1. Configure MissileController in Inspector
1. Select your PlayerShip (or object with MissileController)
2. In the MissileController component:
   - **Missile Type Assets**: Assign your 3 existing ScriptableObjects:
     - MTD-ARM30
     - MTD-ARM60  
     - MTD-ARM90
   - **Flight Data**: Assign your FlightData component
   - **Missile Fire Points**: Assign your missile launch points
   - **Audio Source**: Assign audio source for missile sounds

### 2. Verify MissileTypeData Assets
Your existing assets should have:
- âœ… **MTD-ARM30**: Standard missiles (5 capacity)
- âœ… **MTD-ARM60**: Heavy damage missiles (3 capacity)
- âœ… **MTD-ARM90**: Fast speed missiles (7 capacity)

### 3. How It Works Now
- **Dynamic Capacity**: Each missile type has its own maxCapacity
- **Smart Switching**: When switching types, missile count adjusts to new capacity
- **Audio Support**: Each missile type can have its own launch sound
- **Icon Support**: Each missile type has its own UI icon
- **Cost Per Shot**: Each missile type can cost different amounts

### 4. Key Features
- **Cleaner Organization**: All missile properties in ScriptableObject assets
- **Easy Configuration**: Just assign the 3 existing MTD assets
- **Dynamic UI**: Missile counts change based on selected type
- **Audio Variety**: Different sounds for different missile types

### 5. Testing
1. Play the game
2. Switch between missile types (Standard/HeavyDamage/FastSpeed)
3. Watch the missile count change dynamically
4. Fire missiles and see count decrease
5. Verify different missile types have different capacities

## Benefits
- âœ… **No more inline arrays** - everything in clean ScriptableObjects
- âœ… **Dynamic missile counts** - each type has different capacity
- âœ… **Easy to expand** - just create new MissileTypeData assets
- âœ… **Better organization** - all missile data in dedicated files
- âœ… **UI ready** - icons and names for UI display

## Next Steps
1. Assign the 3 MTD assets to MissileController
2. Test missile switching and firing
3. Verify UI updates show correct counts
4. Enjoy your clean missile system! ðŸš€
